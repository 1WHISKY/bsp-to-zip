# BSP to ZIP

This is a small python script to quickly extract the packed content of a BSP map file for source engine games.
Once executed a new zip-file will be created in the same directory as the original file.

It is designed to be used with the "Send to" functionality of Windows but feel free to use this however you want.

To add this to your "Send to" menu you have to create a shortcut to the bsp-to-zip script in this location:  
`%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo`
